# Workstation setup

My workstation setup repo.  Designed to get initial setup performed to make a workstation "usable".  

This repo is primarily focused on getting the initial OS buildout done and in a state where the code in https://github.com/ssmiller25/toolbox can be run (sets of tooling to be used in a variety of situations, including personalized enviornments).
