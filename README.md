# Workstation setup

My workstation setup repo.  Designed to get initial setup performed to make a workstation "usable".  

This repo is primarily focused on getting the initial OS buildout done and in a state where the code in https://github.com/ssmiller25/toolbox can be run (sets of tooling to be used in a variety of situations, including personalized enviornments).

## Instructions - MacOS


Run the following 

```sh
curl -fsSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssmiller25/wksetup/main/setup-mac.sh | sh
```
You may need to run the above several times in order to finish setup, as a few reboots are required.

## Instructions - PopOS
