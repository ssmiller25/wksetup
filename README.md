# Workstation setup

My workstation setup repo.  Right now focused on Linux, but hopefully will
encompass all the desktop environments I plan on using.

This repo is primarily focused on getting the initial OS buildout done and
in a state where the code in https://github.com/ssmiller25/immutabledesktop can
be run.
